# FF and Metric-FF Planners

This repo contains the various versions of `FF` and `Metric-FF`. Its original site can be found [here](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/ff.html)

To compile we need to install `flex` and `bison`. In Ubuntu:

```shell
$ sudo apt install flex bison
```

Planners have ben configured with a max number of operators of 5000. This can be changed by setting `MAX_OPERATORS` in the `ff.h` files.

The folder `bin/` contains compiled binary versions for Linux.

Finally, binaries have been renamed to `ff` and `mff` and with their corresponding variables, so that it is clear which planner we are running. Originally, all the binaries were called `ff`.

Performance results can be found [here](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/2002.html).

## FF Versions

- `ff2.3`: this is the original FF v2.2 as used in the 2nd International Planning Competition, modulo removal of a few minor bugs in the pre-processing phase, plus handling of ADL enhanced goal orderings pruning technique and with the ordering information provided by the Goal Agenda (adapted from Jana Koehler's work).
- `ff2.3-suda`: Martin Suda has contributed a patched version of FF-v2.3 whose parser is supposed to be able to parse larger inputs.
- `ff2.3-goldman`: Robert Goldman patched version of FF-v2.3 in which the parser allows newlines within typed lists.

**Note:** The versions in this repo (source and binaries) have all had their limits increased as per the `suda` version. So, the version that has all the extensions would be `ff2.3-goldman`.

A run example:

```shell
‚ùØ bin/ff2.3 -o pddl/ff/inventory/inventory-domain.pddl -f pddl/ff/inventory/inventory-p01-sokoban.pddl

ff: parsing domain file
domain 'INVENTORY-PATH' defined
 ... done.
ff: parsing problem file
problem 'INVENTORY-PATH1' defined
 ... done.

## Metric-FF Versions

 A natural extension of FF's algorithms to a subset of PDDL 2.1 level 2, i.e. to numerical state variables; more precisely, Metric-FF's algorithms can handle effects and constraints on linear functions over numerical state variables (more details available on the Metric-FF homepage).

- `mff1.0`: Metric-FF as used in the competition.
- `mff2.0`: a version that treats additive cost minimization in a much better way, using A*-epsilon to combine the usual relaxed plan goal-distance estimation with relaxed plan remaining-cost estimation. As a gimmick, this version also handles a simple form of derived predicates where those predicates are not allowed to occur negated in preconditions/axiom conditions/goals.
- `mff2.1`: like 2.0 except it adds the possibility to specify an upper bound on plan cost. (If that is done, states are pruned based on g + hmax.)

An example run:

```shell
./bin/mff2.1 -o pddl/mff/depots-numeric-automatic/domain.pddl -f pddl/mff/depots-numeric-automatic/instances/instance-10.pddl
